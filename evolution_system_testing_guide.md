## 📊 **Evolution Conditions Explained**

The system calculates evolution requirements based on your actual workout data:

```javascript
// Example evolution conditions:
{
  requiredWorkouts: 5,      // Base workouts needed
  requiredTypes: ["chest", "cardio"],  // Your preferred workout types
  minWorkoutStreak: 3       // Consecutive days
}
