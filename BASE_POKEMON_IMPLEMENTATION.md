# Base Pokemon Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a feature that modifies the Pokemon random selection to only include base Pokemon (first in evolution chains or Pokemon that don't evolve at all).

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `getBasePokemon()` Function

A new function `getBasePokemon()` was added to `src/utils/pokemonApi.ts` that extracts base Pokemon IDs from the evolution data in `src/utils/evolutionDataSources.ts`. This function identifies Pokemon that are either first in evolution chains or don't evolve at all by using the `FALLBACK_EVOLUTION_DATA` object keys as the source of base Pokemon IDs.

### 2. Modified `getRandomPokemon()` Function

The existing `getRandomPokemon()` function was modified to use the filtered list of base Pokemon instead of selecting from all Pokemon IDs 1-1025. The function now:

1. Calls `getBasePokemon()` to get the valid base Pokemon IDs
2. Randomly selects from that filtered list
3. Fetches the Pokemon data for the selected ID

### 3. Import Statement

Added an import statement to access the `evolutionDataProvider` from `evolutionDataSources.ts` to access the evolution data.

## Implementation Details

The implementation leverages the existing `EvolutionDataProvider` class and its fallback data to ensure we have comprehensive coverage of base Pokemon across all generations. Base Pokemon are identified as top-level keys in the `FALLBACK_EVOLUTION_DATA` object.

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Ensures that only base Pokemon (first in evolution chains or non-evolving Pokemon) are selected
2. **Completeness**: Uses comprehensive evolution data that covers all Pokemon generations
3. **Efficiency**: Leverages existing data structures and caching mechanisms
4. **Maintainability**: Builds on existing code patterns and structures

## Testing

A test file `tests/base-pokemon-test.ts` was created to verify that the implementation works correctly. The test verifies that:
1. The `getRandomPokemon()` function returns Pokemon from the base Pokemon list
2. No non-base Pokemon are selected
3. The function correctly fetches Pokemon data for the selected base Pokemon

## Files Modified

- `src/utils/pokemonApi.ts`: Added `getBasePokemon()` function and modified `getRandomPokemon()` function
- `src/utils/evolutionDataSources.ts`: No changes needed (used as data source)

## Files Added

- `tests/base-pokemon-test.ts`: Test file to verify implementation
- `base-pokemon-implementation-todo.md`: Todo list for tracking implementation progress
